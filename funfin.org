* A Purely Functional Approach

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Driven by CSV statements - the input data
 - Classified with rules - the functions
 - Generated plain text journal files - the output

* Example

** An input file

#+NAME: myaccount-jan2018.csv
#+BEGIN_SRC csv
2,account_number,'MR JOHN D DEER','FNB TJEKREKENING'
3,,'Staat'
3,'Staatnommer','Vanaf Datum','Tot Datum','Openingsaldo','Afsluitingsaldo','BTW Gehef'
3,55,'28 Desember 2017','28 Januarie 2018',0.01,0.01,-0.01
4,,'Opsomming'
5,,'Transaksies'
5,'Nommer','Datum','Beskrywing1','Beskrywing2','Beskrywing3','Bedrag','Saldo','Opgeloopte Koste'
5,1,'29 Des',"Payment received","Company, Inc",,5000.01,7000.01,
5,2,'01 Jan',"POS Transaction","Grocery Store","My town",-4000.00,3000.01,
6,'END'
#+END_SRC
